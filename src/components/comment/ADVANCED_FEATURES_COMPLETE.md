# 🚀 COMPLETED: Advanced Reaction Features Implementation

## 📋 Summary
Successfully implemented 3 advanced features for the comment system's reaction functionality:

### ✅ **1. Persist Reaction State**
- **Feature**: Selected reaction persists when modal closes/reopens
- **Implementation**: Added `persistedReaction` state management in `CommentReactionButton`
- **Benefits**: Better UX, no lost state when navigating reaction picker

### ✅ **2. Support Reaction Switching** 
- **Feature**: Allow changing from one reaction to another seamlessly
- **Implementation**: Enhanced `handleReaction` logic with improved switching
- **Benefits**: Users can easily change their mind about reactions

### ✅ **3. Stacked Reactions Display**
- **Feature**: Implement overlapped reaction display to save space
- **Implementation**: Created new `CommentReactionStack` component
- **Benefits**: Compact UI, better visual hierarchy, space-efficient
