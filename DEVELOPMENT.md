# Frontend Development Tips and Best Practices

This document provides tips and best practices for developing the SocialApp frontend.

## Code Structure

- **Components**: Reusable UI components that don't contain business logic
- **Pages**: Top-level components that correspond to routes
- **Context**: React Context for state management across components
- **Services**: API services and other business logic
- **Utils**: Helper functions and utilities
- **Styles**: CSS styles for components and pages

## State Management

- Use React Context for global state (auth, theme, etc.)
- Use `useState` for component-local state
- Consider using React Query for API data fetching and caching

## Component Best Practices

- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use function components with hooks instead of class components
- Use TypeScript for type safety (if applicable)
- Follow a consistent naming convention (PascalCase for components)
- Add JSDoc comments for props and functions

## Styling

- Use CSS modules or CSS-in-JS for component-scoped styles
- Follow a consistent naming convention for CSS classes
- Use design tokens for colors, spacing, fonts, etc.

## Performance

- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Use `useCallback` for functions passed as props to memoized components
- Use `useMemo` to memoize expensive calculations
- Virtualize long lists (consider using `react-window` or `react-virtualized`)
- Lazy load components with `React.lazy` and `Suspense`

## Authentication

- Store JWT token in localStorage or HTTP-only cookies
- Include token in API requests as Bearer token
- Handle token expiration and refresh
- Protect routes that require authentication

## Form Handling

- Use Formik for form state management and validation
- Use Yup for schema validation
- Handle form errors gracefully

## Testing

- Write unit tests for critical components and functions
- Test authentication flows and protected routes
- Test form validations and submissions
- Mock API responses for testing

## Accessibility

- Use semantic HTML elements
- Provide alt text for images
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Use ARIA attributes when needed
- Test with screen readers

## Browser Compatibility

- Test in major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Use polyfills for modern JavaScript features

## API Integration

- Keep API calls in service files
- Handle loading and error states
- Use consistent error handling
- Consider using React Query for data fetching and caching
